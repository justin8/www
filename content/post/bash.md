You know what? Bash is awesome. A lot of people underestimate it and often dismiss it as 'not a real programming language'. But the reality is far different. It may not be as performant as C or as pretty as Python, but it certainly has its place, particularly as a glue of sorts between external libraries and functions.

If you're trying to make a RESTful API or a data crunching application, Bash is a very poor choice. But if you make anything that has large amounts of interactions with the local system, Bash is fantastic.

The main problem is the 30 years of legacy, lack of dependency or package management (at least in something resembling a modern language's management) and the extremely low bar for entry means many years of bad practices get maintained. Whether it's via people copying scripts they don't understand to make a minor change, or because it worked for 20 years without change, so why do it now? It all means that finding a good example of a Bash script can be pretty hard as misinformation is everywhere.

With this in mind, I'm going to start posting some random snippets and special obscurities of various commands, functions and resources over time to here.
