I've decided that I should start a blog again. I had one once upon a time, but it is long gone now. I just need somewhere to write down the little things I learn sometimes, or that I find an answer to after spending way too long reading google/stackoverflow/forums/etc and coming up with nothing at all resembling a useful answer. It is definitely a problem I face more and more often; I'm unsure yet if it is because I'm only looking for harder and more niche problems these days, or if my google-fu is becoming weaker over the years. But at the very least I might be able to help those who manage to find the same problems and are in need of a solution.

So here we are! The beginnings of another blog...
